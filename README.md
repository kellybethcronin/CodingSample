# Coding Sample

## Hello, and welcome!  

This is a sample of code I've written in conjunction with the Harvard Business Review case study "Predicting Customer Churn at QWE INC."  This was originally developed as an assignment in a masters-level Marketing Analytics course.  

I have provided here all relevant materials for understanding the context for this analysis, including the case study, the data set, and my .RMD code. 

  - __HBS Case- Predicting Customer Churn at QWE Inc.pdf__ - The HBR case study
  - __HBS Case- Predicting Customer Churn at QWE Inc.xlsx__ - The relevant customer data
  - __CodeSample_KCronin_Churn at QWE Inc.rmd__ - The code used to understand the problem, perform analysis, and then submit a recommendation for best model to use for predicting churn. 
  - __Churn-at-QWE-Inc_KellyCronin2.html__ - The .html output of the .rmd file.
